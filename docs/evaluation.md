# Evaluation

In FUSION, we evaluate models on a diverse set of 21 benchmarks. To ensure the reproducibility, we evaluate the models with greedy decoding. We do not evaluate using beam search to make the inference process consistent with the chat demo of real-time outputs.

we have adapted lmms-eval and provided the corresponding model files, available in the [lmms-eval/](https://github.com/starriver030515/FUSION/tree/main/scripts/lmms-eval) folder. Additionally, we have implemented benchmark evaluation code in LLaVA format for quick evaluation, found in the [eval/](https://github.com/starriver030515/FUSION/tree/main/scripts/eval) folder.

## Evaluate with lmms-eval

This is the recommended method for evaluating the FUSION model.

Simply follow the instructions in the lmms-eval README to set up both the lmms-eval and FUSION environments. After configuration, copy the files from the [lmms-eval/](https://github.com/starriver030515/FUSION/tree/main/scripts/lmms-eval) folder into lmms-eval/models. Then, update lmms-eval/models/\_\_init\_\_.py by adding the following entries to AVAILABLE_MODELS:

```
"fusion_phi": "Fusion_Phi",
"fuson": "Fusion_LLaMA",
```

To run evaluations, simply specify --model Fusion_Phi or --model Fusion_LLaMA.

**Note:**

lmms-eval does not support benchmarks such as CV-Bench and MMVP. To evaluate on these benchmarks, please use the scripts provided directly in the [eval/](https://github.com/starriver030515/FUSION/tree/main/scripts/eval) folder.

## Evaluate on Custom Datasets

We followed the evaluation of LLaVA. You can evaluate FUSION on your custom datasets by converting your dataset to LLaVA's jsonl format, and evaluate using [`model_vqa.py`](https://github.com/starriver030515/FUSION/blob/main/fusion/eval/model_vqa.py).

Below we provide a general guideline for evaluating datasets with some common formats.

1. Short-answer (e.g. MME).

```
<question>
Answer the question using a single word or phrase.
```

2. Option-only for multiple-choice (e.g. MMBench, SEED-Bench).

```
<question>
A. <option_1>
B. <option_2>
C. <option_3>
D. <option_4>
Answer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.
```

3. Natural QA (e.g. LLaVA-Bench, MM-Vet).

No postprocessing is needed.

### Notes:

We also provide a separate eval repository that organizes the above benchmark evaluations for convenience. You can directly download this from our Hugging Face repository:

ðŸ‘‰ [FUSION Evaluation Benchmarks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/starriver030515/FUSION-Eval)

This repository includes structured resources for the above benchmarks, making it easier to set up and run evaluations.
